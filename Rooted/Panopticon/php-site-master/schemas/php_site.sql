Please\n         report any findings to the <a href=\"mailto:php-qa@lists.php.net\">QA mailinglist</a>\n         or the <a href=\"http://bugs.php.net\">bug tracker</a>.</p>\n        <p>There have been a great number of other additions and improvements, but here is a short overview of the most important changes:</p>\n        <ul>\n\n          <li><a href=\"http://php.net/language.namespaces\">Namespaces</a> (documentation maybe out dated)</li>\n          <li><a href=\"http://php.net/oop5.late-static-bindings\">Late static binding</a> and <a href=\"http://php.net/language.oop5.overloading\">__callStatic</a></li>\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"http://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures\">Lambda functions and closures</a>\n          </li>\n\n          <li>Addition of the <a href=\"http://php.net/book.intl\">intl</a>, <a href=\"http://php.net/book.phar\">phar</a> (phar is scheduled for some more work a head of alpha2), <a href=\"http://php.net/book.fileinfo\">fileinfo </a> and <a href=\"http://php.net/book.sqlite3\">sqlite3</a> extensions</li>\n          <li>Optional cyclic garbage collection</li>\n\n          <li>Optional support for the <a href=\"http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/PHP_MYSQLND\">MySQLnd</a> replacement driver for libmysql</li>\n          <li>Windows older than Windows 2000 (Windows 98, NT4, etc.) are not supported anymore (<a href=\"http://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/releasenotes\">details</a>)</li>\n          <li>New syntax features like <a href=\"http://php.net/language.types.string#language.types.string.syntax.nowdoc\">NOWDOC</a>, limited GOTO, ternary short cut \"?:\"</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>Several under the hood changes also require in depth testing with existing applications to ensure that any backwards compatibility breaks are minimized. This is especially important for users that require the undocumented Zend engine multibyte support.</p>\n        <p>The current <a href=\"http://wiki.php.net/todo/php53\">release plan</a> states that there will be alpha/beta/RC releases in 2-3 week intervals with an expected stable release of PHP 5.3 between mid September and mid October of 2008.</p>\n      </div>\n    \n    </div>\n</div>'),(581,'en','testfest-2008-wrap-up','TestFest 2008 wrap-up','2008',1217394000,1217394000,NULL,'<div class=\"newsItem hentry\">\n\n    <div class=\"newsImage\"></div>\n    \n    <div class=\"entry-content description\">\n        \n        <div>\n        <p>Overall 158 tests have been submitted as part of <a href=\"http://qa.php.net/testfest.php\">TestFest 2008</a> since the launch of the <a href=\"http://testfest.php.net\">TestFest submission site</a> by 30 different people from people all over the world. Actually this is not counting the various submissions by existing core developers, who also took this opportunity to add some more tests. This has actually increased total <a href=\"http://gcov.php.net/\" target=\"_new\">test coverage</a> for ext/reflection, ext/dom and ext/exif by about 10% each. While the organization of the TestFest was a bit adhoc, there were numerous TestFest events in local user groups. So the number of people exposed to the PHP test framework is much greater. Hopefully this will lead to more people submitting bug reports with an accompanying <a href=\"http://qa.php.net/write-test.php\">phpt</a> test file!</p>\n\n        <p>Our top submitter Felix De Vliegher has actually committed his last submissions himself since, based on the high quality of his submissions, he has been granted commit rights to the PHP repository. We have not heard back from all participants, but we encourage everybody to <a href=\"http://www.deshong.net/?p=76\" target=\"_new\">blog</a> about their experience and provide us with feedback on how to improve future events.</p>\n        <p>Now better late than never, here are the 10 winners of the promised <a href=\"http://flickr.com/groups/elephpants/pool/\">elePHPant</a> raffle sponsored by <a href=\"http://www.nexen.net\">Nexen</a>. Note that Felix asked me not to include him in the raffle, since he is already herding quite a number of elePHPants at home.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Eric Stewart</li>\n\n          <li>Håvard Eide</li>\n          <li>Marc Veldman</li>\n          <li>Michelangelo van Dam</li>\n          <li>Rein Velt</li>\n          <li>Rob Young</li>\n          <li>Sami Greenbury</li>\n\n          <li>Sebastian Deutsch</li>\n          <li>Sebastian Schürmann</li>\n          <li>Stefan Koopmanschap</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>We will provide Nexen with the email addresses of the winners, so that they can arrange to get the elePHPants shipped. Also for those people wondering, you can continue to submit tests on the <a href=\"http://testfest.php.net\">TestFest submission site</a>. A bit thank you to all participants and TestFest organizers! Without the countless people that helped organize local events, implement the infrastructure and submissions reviewers, the TestFest would have obviously not worked out as well as it has.

This is only used in the case of an `indexed\' query. This\n        is identified by a \"GET\" or \"HEAD\" HTTP request with a URL search\n        string not containing any unencoded \"=\" characters.\n     </cite>\n     \n     <p>So, requests that do not have a \"=\" in the query string are treated\n     differently from those who do in some CGI implementations. For PHP this\n     means that a request containing ?-s may dump the PHP source code for the\n     page, but a request that has ?-s&amp;=1 is fine.</p>\n     \n     <p>A large number of sites run PHP as either an Apache module through\n     mod_php or using php-fpm under nginx. Neither of these setups are\n     vulnerable to this. Straight shebang-style CGI also does not appear to\n     be vulnerable.</p>\n     \n     <p>If you are using Apache mod_cgi to run PHP you may be vulnerable. To see\n     if you are, just add ?-s to the end of any of your URLs. If you see your\n     source code, you are vulnerable. If your site renders normally, you are not.</p>\n     \n     <p>To fix this, update to PHP 5.3.12 or PHP 5.4.2. </p>\n     \n     <p>We recognize that since CGI is a rather outdated way to run PHP, it may not be feasible to\n     upgrade these sites to a modern version of PHP. An alternative is to\n     configure your web server to not let these types of requests with query\n     strings starting with a \"-\" and not containing a \"=\" through. Adding a\n     rule like this should not break any sites. For Apache using mod_rewrite\n     it would look like this:</p>\n     \n     <pre>\n         RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(%2d|-)[^=]+$ [NC]\n         RewriteRule ^(.*) $1?
